# Improved Characters Implementation

## Changes Made

1. Added the `createImprovedCharacters.js` script to `index.html`
   - This script contains enhanced 3D models for the hero and monsters

2. Modified `game.js` to use the improved character models:
   - Replaced `this.createCharacters()` with `this.createImprovedCharacters()` in the `init()` method
   - Replaced `this.createMonsterByOperation()` with `this.createImprovedMonsterByOperation()` in the `startNewLevel()` method

3. Fixed hero animation issue:
   - Updated the `setupHeroAnimations()` method to store original positions of body parts
   - Modified animation to use original positions as reference points to prevent floating body parts

4. Modified division problem generation:
   - Removed logic that intentionally created division problems with remainders in 'hard' mode
   - All division problems now result in whole number answers, regardless of difficulty

5. Prevented repeating questions:
   - Added a history mechanism (`problemHistory`) to `MathProblemGenerator`
   - The generator now checks the history (last 20 questions) before issuing a new problem
   - If a duplicate is generated, it attempts to create a new, unique question

6. Fixed bug introduced in step 5:
   - Corrected return statements in internal problem generation methods (`...Internal`) in `mathProblems.js`
   - This resolved an issue where graphics were disappearing due to errors in problem generation logic

7. Randomized monster appearance:
   - Modified `startNewLevel` in `game.js` to randomly select a monster type ('addition', 'subtraction', 'multiplication', 'division') for each battle
   - The monster's appearance is no longer tied to the selected math operation type

8. Added hit feedback:
   - Implemented `animateMonsterHit` in `game.js` to make the monster briefly shrink when damaged.
   - Added `<audio>` elements for three hit sounds (`hit-sound-1`, `hit-sound-2`, `hit-sound-3`) to `index.html`.
   - Updated `playHitSound` method in `game.js` to randomly select and play one of the three hit sounds.
   - Updated `animateHeroAttack` to trigger the random hit sound and monster shrink animation (`animateMonsterHit`) sequentially when the attack animation completes.
   - Removed separate monster pain sounds.

9. Added error sound on incorrect answer:
   - Added `<audio>` element for `ERror.mp3` to `index.html`.
   - Implemented `playErrorSound` method in `game.js`.
   - Updated `submitAnswer` to call `playErrorSound` when an answer is incorrect.

## New Features

The improved characters include:

### Hero Character
- Detailed 3D model with proper body proportions
- Clothing, face details, and a sword
- Animated breathing and subtle movements

### Monster Characters
- Unique themed monsters for each operation type:
  - Addition: Red flame monster with fire animations
  - Subtraction: Blue ice monster with crystal animations
  - Multiplication: Purple arcane monster with magical animations
  - Division: Green nature monster with plant-like features
- Boss versions with crowns and enhanced appearances
- Built-in animations for each monster type

## Technical Improvements
- Better use of Three.js materials with appropriate roughness and metalness
- Improved shadow casting for better visual quality
- Animation system using TWEEN.js for smooth character movements
